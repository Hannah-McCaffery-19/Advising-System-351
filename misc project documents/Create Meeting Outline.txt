You will need entries in the Availability table, so here is some test data:

--- Availability Data ---

INSERT INTO `availability` (`facultyID_fk_avail`, `day`, `availabilityStart`, `availabilityEnd`) VALUES 
('00912116', 'Monday', '12:00', '12:30'),
('00912116', 'Monday', '14:00', '15:00'),
('00912116', 'Tuesday', '11:00', '12:00'),
('00912116', 'Tuesday', '12:30', '13:30'),
('00912116', 'Tuesday', '16:00', '16:30'),
('00912116', 'Wednesday', '12:00', '12:30'),
('00912116', 'Wednesday', '14:00', '15:00'),
('00912116', 'Thursday', '11:00', '12:00'),
('00912116', 'Thursday', '12:30', '13:30'),
('00912116', 'Thursday', '16:00', '16:30'),
('00912116', 'Friday', '12:00', '12:30');

--- ^ TO USE --- 
in phpMyAdmin, select the Availability table from the side nav,
go to 'SQL' tab at the top, clear suggested code, paste, and hit Go


A student is only able to create a meeting with their own advisor,
and their advisor's ID is stored as a session variable upon logging in
($_SESSION['advisor']) so there only needs to be an initial query for each
day of the week that pulls from the Availability table with advisor as the key.
This is done to display the advisor's availability to the student.

--- PHP Needed for sure ---

$advisorID = $_SESSION['advisor'];
$query = "SELECT * FROM availability WHERE facultyID_fk_avail = '$advisorID' AND day = 'Monday'";
mysqli_multi_query($connect, $query);

do {
	if ($result = mysqli_store_result($connect)) {
		while ($available = mysqli_fetch_row($result)) {
			
			**YOUR CODE HERE**
		
		}
	}
} 
while (mysqli_next_result($connect));

--- ^ repeat for EACH day of the week (mon-fri) ---

The inner while loop will pull up the advisor's availability on that selected
day, one entry at a time. The start time can be accessed with $available[2]
and the end time likewise is $available[3]. For an example of how to format
output from a repeated query, look at what I did in info_profile_student.php.

All that is left to do is to create a form using HTML (see the login form in
index.html for an example) where the student selects a location (should be
office or online), a start time plus a meeting duration (10, 15, 20, or 30 minutes)
create a short bit of php to do the math from those two to calculate the
end time, and include a text box for the student to add notes. Use php to
generate a random ID for the meetingID (rand(100000, 999999);).
studentID_fk_meet should be passed as the session username ($_SESSION['username'];)
facultyID_fk_meet should be passed as the session advisor ($_SESSION['advisor'];)
Refer to the Meeting table to make sure everything is properly named and set.
This form should submit the data to the Meeting table and append it as a new row.
